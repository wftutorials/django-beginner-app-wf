# dgroups

This is a tutorial using the Django Web Framework. I built it to help me understand web development using this python web framework. I also wrote a blog about building this application. You can find the url for the blog somewhere.

Django is a really cool web framework and was very intuitive. The name of the project is dgroups which means django groups. It basically is a application to create users and groups and attach users to groups.
